FX Intraday Patterns

This repository contains : <br> - the source code for the research based on the article in ./src
                           <br>- the article itself : fx_intraday_pattern_article.pdf
                           <br>- the results in several formats: results_notebook.html , results_notebook.pdf, results_notebook.ipynb
                           
I would suggest seeing the results in .html format (results_notebook.html), because the jupyter notebook might lose some of the color formatting I've added for convienence (depending on the version you're running).

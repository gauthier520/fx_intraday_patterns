FX Intraday Patterns

This repository contains : - the source code for the research based on the article in ./src
                           - the article itself : fx_intraday_pattern_article.pdf
                           - the results in several formats: results_notebook.html , results_notebook.pdf, results_notebook.ipynb
                           
I would suggest seeing the results in .html format (results_notebook.html) as based on the version you're running, the jupyter notebook can lose some of the color formatting I've added for convienence.
